#About

JSR-303 Validators to validate a daterange and other constraints.

This is a fork of [erichegt/dateRangeValidator](https://github.com/erichegt/dateRangeValidator).

#Examples 

For examples please see the tests or this projects homepage: [http://waxolunist.github.com/validationconstraints/](http://waxolunist.github.com/validationconstraints/).

#What is different

The original version did only allow Calendar to validate. This fork uses the library [joda-time](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/).
Thus it supports validating every class which can be converted to [DateTime](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/api-release/index.html).
